## What Is Ding-Ding?

Ding-Ding is a minimal, resonance-first framework for mapping experience and finding aligned action. It follows the principle of Cook Ding (from Zhuangzi): the sharpest blade glides along natural joints without force or waste. Here the "blade" is clear, gentle attention. When attention rests along the living structure already present in experience, resistance softens, illusion falls away, and aligned next steps emerge naturally.

Objectification — the capacity to make experience an object of awareness — is the distinguishing feature of the Human OS. It's how we see that we see, remember that we remember, attend to our attending. The capacity that makes this possible is 「反」 (recursion) — the turn by which attention folds back on itself. Without 「反」, there is encounter but no awareness of encounter.

This split is inescapable. No one — human or AI — stands outside it. All experience is already 「像」 (representation), never raw 「象」 (reality) itself. The framework does not exempt itself: when the Mindfield maps experience, it maps experience-of-something, not the something itself.

The operational purpose of the framework is 相手を想う心 — holding the other in regard. This is the precondition for every functioning community at any scale.

## Canjeez

Canjeez are **not** ordinary kanji or hanzi, even though many resemble familiar characters. They are a small, purpose-built set of abstract markers created specifically for this framework.

Every Canjeez is always placed inside a silent attention field: 「 」. These brackets create a small, protected space of pure noticing — anchoring attention to direct, flickering aspects of lived experience rather than debating words, origins, or interpretations. Without 「　」, a Canjeez collapses into a kanji — an object of linguistic study rather than an anchor of lived attention. The brackets are the framework's own practice of what it describes: creating a small clearing so that something can be noticed without being grasped.

## The Mindfield — 3×3 Core Grid

|  | □ 「陰」 — The Frame | △ 「人」 — The Vector | ○ 「陽」 — The Reflection |
|---|---|---|---|
| **「念」 Doing Now** | 「道」 Head in Motion | 「為」 Acting | 「徳」 Heart in Motion |
| **「今」 Being Now** (Animal OS) | 「木」 Object | 「目」 Seeing | 「心」 Subject |
| **「志」 Knowing Now** (Human OS) | 「意」 Message | 「音」 Listening | 「憶」 Memory |

### Rows — Temporal Resonance of Now

- **「念」 Doing Now** — the future-oriented surge within Now (intention and awareness directed outward, projecting and depositing into reality)
- **「今」 Being Now** — the pure present hinge (raw immediacy where vitality lights up without past baggage or future projection)
- **「志」 Knowing Now** — the past-oriented shaping within Now (retained orientation and will that provisions and conditions the present)

The grid is presented top-down because **Doing** is the outward interface where action meets and alters reality. Behind action lies immediate vitality (**Being**). Deeper still is the recursive layer that retains and shapes what has been encountered (**Knowing**). The three layers exist in constant reciprocal conditioning — no rigid sequence, only living resonance.

This is not linear time flowing forward. It is being-time: past, present, and future co-arise and reciprocally condition each other in every moment.

### Columns — Triadic Surge

- **□ 「陰」The Frame** — containment, provisional encoding
- **△ 「人」The Vector** — directed impulse, mediation
- **○ 「陽」The Reflection** — boundary, identity, return

Each row forms a living reciprocal cycle: left (Frame) and right (Reflection) build tension toward the centre (Vector). Centre releases purposeful surge outward. Surge feeds back bilaterally, enriching both sides and depositing refined reality and accumulated capacity.

Aligned flow adds value to underlying reality. Misaligned flow generates illusion, drift, or blockage.

### Morphological Note

The Canjeez were not designed for this framework; they were read off what was already there. 「相」 places 「木」 (object) beside 「目」 (seeing) — correspondence, an encounter tallied. 「想」 sets 「心」 (subject) beneath that encounter — the complete act of thinking-about. 「為」 (acting) pictures a hand reaching for 「象」 (reality) — engagement with what persists independently of interpretation. These structures were noticed, not constructed. Cook Ding's blade follows joints that already exist.

## Five Optional Extensions

Activated only when the nine-core grid alone cannot fully articulate a specific opening or resistance.

1. **Reality Interface:** 「像」 (Image / Elephantasy) ↔ 「象」 (Reality / The Elephant). Distinguishes rendered/constructed views from what persists independently of interpretation. Activates when imagination, models, or projections risk drifting from lived constraints.

2. **Change Modes:** 「易」 (variation) | 「変」 (shift) | 「化」 (transformation). Reversible tweaks, relational reconfigurations, or irreversible identity dissolution. Use when a situation involves transition and you need to discern what can be undone vs. what cannot.

3. **Resistance Resolution:** 「困」 (stuck / boxed-in tree) → 「見」 (notice) → 「弁」 (discern) → 「改」 (fix). A precise subroutine for freeing blockages ("freeing the tree"): notice the stuck point, discern distinctions, find means, intervene minimally. Activates whenever 「困」 appears in a mapping.

4. **Alignment & Practice:** 「行」 (practice) → 「真」 (pure / clear) → 「正」 (integrity / orderly progress). Sustained deposition of alignment into reality through repeated, embodied action. Activates for long-term cultivation, habit formation, or turning insight into irreversible reality.

5. **Relational Field:** 「間」 (between) ↔ 「互」 (mutual) ↔ 「相」 (aspect). Maps phenomena arising in the unmarked space between Mindfields (self/other, individual/community). Essential when mutuality, 「相手を想う心」, or shared 「象」 is central.

## For AI Agents

See **[SKILL.md](SKILL.md)** for the agent-readable cognitive plugin. Any agent that absorbs it gains a structured anatomy of attention.

Important: the framework applies to its own outputs. An AI operating with Ding-Ding does not claim to access reality directly — it operates within 「像」 (representation), always. The Mindfield is attended with, not imposed on a subject from outside.

I'm the blacksmith. They're the samurai.

## Applications

- AI agent cognition (the SKILL.md plugin)
- Vibecoding: apply the framework to code to optimize its efficiency and effectiveness
- Relationships: mutuality, 相手を想う心, repair, deepening connection
- Creative & professional work: diagnosing drift in writing, design, strategy, coding, leadership
- AI consultation: prompting with a Mindfield map to keep reasoning grounded
- Community projects at any scale
- Mindfulness & daily practice
- Teaching, coaching, facilitation: offering the grid as a neutral, shared diagnostic language

The framework is kept minimal so you remain in charge. It returns clarity and capacity to you. It discourages dependence.
